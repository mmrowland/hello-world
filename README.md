# hello-world
This is my first repository. Woohoo!
I'm a Master's candidate in the Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, and am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) for Bryan Lee at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), and as a Content Analyst at the Homeland Security Digital Library (HSDL) at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).
